This repository contains all the files for the pantilt modification of the exomy rover (see https://esa-prl.github.io/ExoMy/ for more details) and the parts modified for mg996r servos.
This is work in progress.
The pantilt parts are a remix of  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1799905 so credit to Zalophus for his work. 


The pan tilt software has pan tilt controls for the camera in the web GUI.
Additionally it is possible to control the camera via a PS2 game Controller using 
R1/R2 and L1/L2 buttons.

Possibly works also with Xbox One or other controllers but it was not tested for lack of appropriate hardware.
